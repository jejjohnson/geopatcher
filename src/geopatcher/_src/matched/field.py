"""`MatchedField` — composite Field that fans out per-anchor reads.

A `MatchedField` wraps:

* one **primary** `Field` (defines the anchor space, CRS, and domain),
* N **secondary** `Field`s keyed by name,
* a **coregistration callable** per secondary (any `Callable`; the
  intended choice is a `pipekit.Operator` from
  ``geotoolz.geom.coregister``, but the type is the broader Callable
  so geopatcher's core stays framework-free — see ADR-003).

It satisfies the existing `Field` Protocol by exposing the primary's
``domain`` and delegating reads through ``select``. On each
``select(indexer)`` it:

1. reads the primary's patch,
2. reads each secondary's raw patch at the same anchor,
3. pipes the (secondary_raw, primary_patch) pair through that
   secondary's coreg callable,
4. packs everything into a `MatchedPatch`.

Because it *is* a `Field`, every existing `SpatialPatcher` /
geometry / sampler / window / aggregation works on it unchanged.

Scaffolding — `select()` raises `NotImplementedError`.
